---------
- All contributions must follow IUC Standards: https://galaxy-iuc-standards.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
- Tools must represent a free standing tool. If you have written a tool that is only applicable to a specific workflow then you need to reconsider your approach.
- All tools must be added to tool_conf.xml. If it is not to be included in the install, comment out the `<tool file="" />` as `<!-- tool file="" / -->`.
